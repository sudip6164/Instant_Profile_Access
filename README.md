 # Instant Profile Access (Manifest V3)
  
</div>

Applying for a job opportunity? Making a social media profile? Need all your profiles and important links instantly? I have struggled with this a lot, so created this browser extension to store and share your social and important links easily.

## 🤷🏼‍♂️ About This Project

![](/Images/banner.PNG)

This is a browser extension capable of storing your important links in one place.

- Upgraded to Manifest V3: Works on the latest versions of Chrome, Brave, and Edge.
- Improved Storage: Uses chrome.storage.local instead of the older localStorage for better performance.
- Copy on Command: Add your URLs, click save, and copy them whenever you need them.
- Customizable: Use the "Add a New Profile" button to add custom link fields.
